# Web Infrastructure Design

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to design, scale, secure, and monitor web infrastructures using a variety of components such as web servers, application servers, load balancers, firewalls, and databases. It builds upon the systems administration and DevOps track projects and emphasizes practical understanding through diagramming, hands-on configuration, and theoretical explanation.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I will be able to:

- Draw and explain web infrastructure diagrams (1-server, distributed, secure, and scaled-up models).
- Explain the role and function of each component within a web stack.
- Describe the principles of redundancy and fault tolerance.
- Understand and use key DevOps and infrastructure acronyms: **LAMP**, **SPOF**, and **QPS**.
